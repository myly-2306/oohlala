## Code Refactor
After a few touchups, now the navigation links connect with their sequential sections in the body. 
In html, I used semantic elements to rename the elements so they follow the structure of the webpage.
The code is cleaner in css. Unnessessary classes are editted and renamed in html to shorten the length in css.
